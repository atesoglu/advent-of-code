# Advent of Code Challenges Repository

Welcome to the Advent of Code Challenges repository! Here, I'll be sharing my solutions and code for the Advent of Code programming challenges.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place during the holiday season. Each day, from December 1st to December 25th, a new problem is released. These problems are designed to be fun and increasingly challenging algorithmic puzzles.

To learn more about Advent of Code and participate in the challenges, visit [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## How I Use This Repository
In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for each year. I'll be updating this repository daily with my code and explanations for each day's challenge.

### Folder Structure
- `year/day-01/`: Contains the solution and code for Day 01 of Advent of Code.
- `year/day-02/`: Contains the solution and code for Day 02 of Advent of Code.
- *(and so on for each day)*

## Technologies Used
I've employed various programming languages and technologies to solve these challenges, making use of the language-agnostic nature of Advent of Code.

### List of Technologies/Languages
- C#
- JavaScript
- Java
- Go
