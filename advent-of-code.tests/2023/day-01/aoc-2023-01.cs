/// --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---
/// Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look.
/// The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
///
/// You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
///
/// Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked
/// when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
///
/// You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and
/// why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think
/// snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
///
/// As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf
/// who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.

    /// On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
    ///
    /// For example:
    ///
    /// 1abc2
    /// pqr3stu8vwx
    /// a1b2c3d4e5f
    /// treb7uchet

    /// Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
