/// It doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.

/// You turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone!
/// The gondola lift isn't working right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it." You offer to help.

/// The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one.
/// If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.
///
/// The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine.
/// There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum.
